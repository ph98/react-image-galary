### TODO: 
1. use env for API
2. fix SVG
3. Each image apart from the image URL has a title and a short description along with a date field which will be used for sorting.
4. The application should check the API end-point (our mock generator) every 1 minute to check/fetch new images and add them at the bottom of the list.
